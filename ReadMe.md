# üåà VIBGYOR Color Detection App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that detects VIBGYOR colors (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red) in uploaded images using OpenCV and HSV color segmentation. The application extracts the dominant VIBGYOR color regions from an image and highlights them for visualization and understanding.

## üìå Project Overview

The aim of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for detecting and identifying VIBGYOR colors from images. This is particularly useful in educational, artistic, or vision-based applications where distinguishing core color components is essential.

The application leverages:
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **HSV color space** for accurate color filtering
- **Streamlit** for building a fast and interactive web UI

Everything has been developed from scratch by a single contributor, ensuring consistency and a clear understanding of the entire system.
